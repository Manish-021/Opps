# VideoRentalInventorsystem
Object-oriented programming
The goal of this project is to design and implement a simple inventory control system for a small video rental store. Define least two classes : a class
Video to model the video and class VideoStore to model the actual store.

Assume that an object of class video has the following attributes:
1. A title
2. A flag to say whaether it is out or not
3. An average user rating
The VideoStore class will contain at least an instance variable that references an array of video(say length 10). 

The VideoStore will contain the following methods
1. addVideo: add a new video to the inventory.
2. checkOut: chec%s out a video.
3. returnVideo: returns a video to store.
4. receiveRating: take a users rating for the video.
5. listInventory: list the whole inventory of videos in the store.
Finally create a VideostoreLauncher class with a main() method which will test the functionality of your other two classes.
